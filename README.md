# AI Voice in Enterprise – Sales & Procurement Notes

## Why this repo exists
This repository captures my thinking on how generative voice AI can be sold responsibly into enterprise environments, balancing creative opportunity with procurement, legal, and compliance realities.

I am not a software engineer. This repo is a way for me to stay close to technical workflows, product constraints, and real enterprise buying dynamics.

## Core enterprise use cases
- Brand voice consistency across global markets
- Localisation and dubbing at scale
- Audio content for marketing, training, and internal comms
- Accessibility and inclusive content delivery

## Enterprise concerns I think about early
- Data privacy and security
- IP ownership and voice rights
- Model training transparency
- Vendor risk and long-term viability

## How I approach procurement-led deals
- Early alignment on security and compliance requirements
- Clear articulation of ROI beyond “cool tech”
- Close collaboration with legal, finance, and engineering teams
- Avoiding over-promising and protecting delivery credibility

## Open questions for engineering partners
- How voice data is stored and isolated
- Model fine-tuning boundaries
- Latency and scale constraints at enterprise volumes
- Roadmap visibility vs customer commitments
